## Assignment
For most writers, a big problem is writing block. Where you can't think of what to write and you can't write anything.<br>
One of the most interesting solutions to this is a web app called The Most Dangerous Writing App, an online text editor where if you stop writing, all your progress will be lost.<br>
A timer will count down and when the website detects the user has not written anything in the last 5/10 seconds, it will delete all the text they've written so far.<br>
Try it out here: https://www.squibler.io/dangerous-writing-prompt-app <br>
You are going to build a desktop app that has similar functionality. The design is up to you, but it should allow a user to type and if they stop for more than 5 seconds, it should delete everything they've written so far.
